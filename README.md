## Developers

Don't push directly to master branch, instead fork this repo to your account. In your forked repo, don't `commit` changes to **your** master branch.

Clone *your* local fork, and set your upstream to the master i.e. `https://github.com/technocrats4/hackit`. Create a branch
`git checkout -b branchname` and push your commit to your **fork**. And then create a pull request (There's an option to create new pull requests(in your forked repo)).
